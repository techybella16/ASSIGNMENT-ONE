        <h2> Biograpghy</h2>
       <p>
        My name is Gbemisola, my friends call me Bella. For the longest time i
        was very dissatisfied with my last job and increasingly grew impatient
        and fustrated with life at the time. This prompted a search for greener
        pastures;preferebly a remote job that offered bettter work-life balance.
        So, i dont have to deal with the stress of commuting to work daily. I
        have a background in sociology and sales management and worked as a
        sales and marketing lead in the beaauty industry for more than 3years
        before i decided that it was time to move on and transition into tech
        industry. I have always been facsinated by how the web works, the
        designs and intricacies that makes web application what it is. Hence, my
        affinity for front-end development. With keen interest in javaScript and
        web development, Gbemisola is dedicated to building interactive and user
        freindly web applications. After gaining experience in sales and
        management, i sought out a career that offers both creativity and
        financial stability leading me to front end development.
